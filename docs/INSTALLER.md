# Windows Installer

Gilbert Codex ships as a Tauri NSIS setup executable for Windows x64. The installer is meant for customer-style distribution: it installs the desktop app, creates shortcuts, checks the required WebView2 runtime, and uses branded light/dark-safe installer artwork.

## Build The Installer

Run this from the repo root on Windows:

```powershell
npm.cmd run app:installer
```

The script regenerates the NSIS bitmap artwork, builds the React frontend, compiles the Tauri host, and writes the setup executable under:

```text
src-tauri\target\release\bundle\nsis\
```

On Windows, the native helper may shorten Cargo's target directory to avoid long path issues. In that case, the local test installer is written under:

```text
C:\gcn\release\bundle\nsis\
```

Use `npm.cmd run app:build` when you only need the normal Tauri bundle without regenerating installer artwork. On macOS and Linux, `npm run app:build` dispatches to the native app/DMG or deb/AppImage build instead of the Windows installer path.

## Build An Auto-Update Release

Automatic updates require a signed updater bundle and a `latest.json` release asset. The normal local installer script intentionally does not create those artifacts because Tauri requires the private updater signing key at build time.

For a release-capable local build, set the updater signing key in the current PowerShell session and run:

```powershell
$keyPath = "C:\Users\you\.tauri\gilbert-codex.key"
$env:TAURI_SIGNING_PRIVATE_KEY=$keyPath
$env:TAURI_SIGNING_PRIVATE_KEY_PASSWORD=""
npm.cmd run app:release
```

The generic `app:release` script dispatches by host OS: Windows builds the NSIS updater release, macOS builds app/DMG updater artifacts, and Linux builds deb/AppImage updater artifacts. Windows merges `src-tauri/tauri.updater.conf.json`; macOS and Linux use `src-tauri/tauri.macos.updater.conf.json` and `src-tauri/tauri.linux.updater.conf.json` so updater artifacts keep the same platform-specific bundle settings as normal local builds.

The GitHub `Release` workflow builds the Windows NSIS installer and Linux deb/AppImage artifacts with the updater config. It also has macOS app/DMG release jobs, but those jobs publish trusted macOS artifacts only when Apple Developer signing and notarization secrets are configured; otherwise they emit a notice and skip macOS artifact upload so Windows and Linux can continue. The workflow reads the release body from `docs/releases/<tag>.md` when that file exists, computes SHA-256 checksum files for the downloadable artifacts, and uploads the packages, `.sha256` files, updater signatures, and merged `latest.json` feed to GitHub Releases. Push a `v*` tag or dispatch the workflow manually with the release version to start that updater release path. Manual dispatches create a draft release for review; tag pushes publish the release. Add these repository secrets before publishing any updater release:

- `TAURI_SIGNING_PRIVATE_KEY`
- `TAURI_SIGNING_PRIVATE_KEY_PASSWORD` when the key is password-protected
- `GILBERT_PRIVATE_RELEASE_OVERLAY_REPOSITORY`
- `GILBERT_PRIVATE_RELEASE_OVERLAY_TOKEN`
- `GILBERT_PRIVATE_RELEASE_OVERLAY_REF` when the private overlay should build from a branch or tag other than `main`

Add these additional repository secrets before publishing trusted macOS release artifacts:

- `APPLE_CERTIFICATE`
- `APPLE_CERTIFICATE_PASSWORD`
- `APPLE_ID`
- `APPLE_PASSWORD`
- `APPLE_TEAM_ID`
- `KEYCHAIN_PASSWORD`

The private release overlay is a private repository that is checked out only inside GitHub Actions. It lets the public repository stay clean while the release runner restores app-only files before packaging. The overlay can contain:

```text
src/toolBridge/
plugins/
.agents/plugins/
```

`src/toolBridge/index.ts` is required for release builds. `plugins/` and `.agents/plugins/` are optional, but if they exist in the private overlay they are copied into the build workspace before the installer is compiled. These files remain absent from the public GitHub tree.

The release workflow does not require GitHub OAuth, Google OAuth, support-link, provider-key, or other app-user credentials. GitHub and Google OAuth setup is entered by each user in Settings, provider keys stay in local app storage, and the public Cash App funding link is source-level public metadata. Other optional funding-link overrides remain local build configuration only. Do not add app-user OAuth client secrets, tokens, downloaded Google credential JSON, provider keys, or private account data to release variables.

The current macOS local bundle config uses ad-hoc signing (`signingIdentity = "-"`) so local builds can still be inspected without Apple credentials. The GitHub Release workflow skips macOS artifact publication until a Developer ID Application certificate and Apple notarization secrets are available.

Offline dictation is prepared during the Windows release build. The workflow downloads and verifies the Whisper `ggml-base.en.bin` model, prepares pinned LLVM/libclang and Vulkan SDK assets under `.tools`, and builds with the `offline-dictation-gpu` feature so the packaged Windows app can use bundled offline voice input without committing the large model or SDK to the public repository. macOS and Linux release jobs build the standard desktop feature set and still bundle the prepared model resource through the shared Tauri build hook.

## What The Installer Includes

- The compiled Gilbert Codex desktop executable.
- The built React frontend from `dist`.
- Bundled Rust-side runtime dependencies, including SQLite through `rusqlite`'s bundled feature.
- Offline dictation resources prepared during the build, including the verified Whisper model bundled as a Tauri resource.
- App icons, Windows shortcut metadata, publisher metadata, homepage metadata, and the MIT license page.
- A WebView2 runtime check. If WebView2 is missing or older than the configured minimum, the installer downloads and runs Microsoft's bootstrapper silently.
- A selectable install scope so the user can install for the current account or system-wide.

## What Stays Local

Provider API keys, OAuth client secrets, GitHub tokens, Discord settings, local accounts, logs, local databases, workspace files, local scan artifacts, release signing credentials, updater private keys, and private release overlay repository credentials are not bundled into public installers. Those are created or connected by the user after installation or used only by GitHub Actions during packaging.

## Light And Dark Mode

The installer artwork uses a split light/dark visual treatment so the setup flow looks intentional on either Windows theme. Inside the app, Gilbert Codex defaults to the system theme and can be pinned to Light or Dark from Settings > Appearance.

## Release Checklist

Before publishing an installer:

1. Bump `package.json`, `package-lock.json`, `src-tauri/Cargo.toml`, `src-tauri/Cargo.lock`, and `src-tauri/tauri.conf.json` to the release version.
2. Run `npm.cmd run check`.
3. Run `npm.cmd run audit:prod`.
4. Run `npm.cmd run app:release`, or run the GitHub `Release` workflow for the tagged version.
5. Confirm GitHub Releases includes the Windows setup executable, macOS DMG/app updater archive, Linux deb/AppImage, matching `.sha256` files, matching `.sig` files, and `latest.json`.
6. Confirm the SHA-256 values in `docs/releases/<tag>.md` match the uploaded `.sha256` files after the final workflow run.
7. Launch the packaged app from a real install on Windows, macOS, and Linux before calling those platforms verified.
8. Use the in-app update checker against the published release feed.
9. Update `docs/releases/<tag>.md` with file names, sizes, checksums, signing/notarization status, updater feed status, validation status, and known limits before pushing the release tag.

The Windows installer is still unsigned unless a release build is produced with a valid code-signing configuration. Unsigned builds can trigger SmartScreen warnings.
